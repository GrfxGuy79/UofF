                    <p>After months (or, at this point, years) of rumors and anticipation, the Friends
                        reunion of our dreams is now a reality. The cast has gathered for a special on HBO's streaming
                        service, HBO Max, following the iconic sitcom's 25th anniversary. And while there were some
                        bumps in the road to production with the world on pause due to the pandemic, the event we've
                        been waiting for is finally here. Ahead, everything we know about the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trailer shows the cast getting back together on the original Friends studio, testing their
                        trivia knowledge of the show, revisiting key sets, re-reading their lines, and joining James
                        Corden for a joint sit-down interview
                        in front of a live audience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the more candid moments of the interview, we get to see how close the stars' real-life
                        friendships really are. "I love you guys so much," one of the actors says in the middle of a
                        group hug.

                        <p>Chandler is the most amazing and relatable character. He accepted his
                            friends and girlfriend for who they were. It was his insecurities that held him up and
                            made him think practically in the show. But eventually, we see, he did not allow his
                            insecurities to hold him back while he fought against them bravely. He had so much
                            courage to quit his high-paying job and make a new start at the age of 30. Also, he
                            fought with the fear of commitment by marrying first in the lot. Chandler Bing is like
                            the glue that holds the “Friends” together. In times of awkwardness, he helps everyone
                            with a joke to lighten the situation. When everyone is sad and leaving each other by the
                            end of the show, he knows how to break the silence with a sarcastic comment. And the
                            best part, it was not even in the scripts!</p>

                    <div class="column2">
                        <p>Phoebe is by far the most eccentric character on Friends, which is why
                            she’s a fan favorite. Much like her friends, she has a sense of humor that is unique to
                            her and offers enough comedic relief to keep fans coming back nearly 15 years after the
                            show’s ending. From her love of animals to her musical talents, we share all the reasons
                            why Phoebe is the best Friends character, ahead.One of the biggest reasons why Phoebe is
                            the best Friends character is her “out there” personality. She’s hilarious without even
                            trying and always have something strange to say. And while her eclectic behavior is not
                            typically taken seriously, we could all learn something from her. In addition to her
                            musical talents, Phoebe also has the gift of honesty. While it’s not always given at the
                            right time, Phoebe’s friends can always count on her to be straight up with them.</p>

                <h3 class="karen">Karen's Choice: <span class="favname">Joey Tribbiani &amp; Ross Geller</span></h3>

                <section class="karenfav">
                    <figure class="column1">
                        <img src="images/joeyross.jpg" />
                    </figure>

                    <div class="column2">
                        <p>Ross is the only introverted character, Ross is somewhat shy and keeps to
                            himself- especially during his college years when interacting with Rachel, his secret
                            crush. He is thorough and remembers specifics about certain individuals because he
                            values loyalty. He tends to make decisions with his heart, which leads to emotional pain
                            and heartache most of the time ( just review his three failed marriages and his
                            relationship rollercoaster with Rachel.) He likes to have an orderly and harmonious
                            environment because he disliked conflict. Thus, it is no surprise that Ross is highly
                            agreeable, as demonstrated by his compassion, trust, and generosity. He is very willing
                            to compromise his interests for those of others. Monica sometimes criticizes him for
                            being their parents’ favorite child because he always tried to please them with his
                            highly agreeable tendencies. Joey, could not be a more extroverted individual. He
                            constantly thrusts himself into new social situations because of his occupation as an
                            actor. Joey is loyal and a very protected friend and a charm!</p>
