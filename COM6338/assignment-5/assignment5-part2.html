            <h2>The Plot of Snow White</h2>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during a winter snowfall when
                she
                pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the freshly fallen
                white snow on the black windowsill. Then, she says to herself, "How I wish that I had a daughter
                that
                had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony." Sometime later, the
                queen
                gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth.
                <span id="plottext"><br><br>
                    A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is
                    very beautiful, but she
                    is a
                    vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which
                    she
                    asks
                    every morning, "Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?" The mirror always
                    tells
                    the
                    queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that response because the magic
                    mirror
                    never lies. But when Snow White is seven years old, her fairness surpasses that of her
                    stepmother.
                    When
                    the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.
                    <br><br>
                    This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart
                    turns
                    against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry
                    queen
                    orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest to be killed. As proof that Snow White is
                    dead,
                    the
                    queen demands that he returns with her heart, which she will consume in order to become
                    immortal.
                    The
                    huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable
                    to
                    kill
                    her when Snow White learns of her stepmother's evil plan and tearfully begs, "Spare me this
                    mockery
                    of
                    justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!" After seeing the tears in
                    the
                    princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the
                    heart
                    of
                    an animal instead.
                    <br><br>
                    After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a
                    group
                    of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their
                    wine,
                    and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her, and she falls
                    asleep.
                    When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there has been a burglar in
                    their
                    house,
                    because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs
                    and
                    discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's
                    attempt
                    to
                    kill her, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a
                    housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are
                    working in
                    the mountains.
                    <br><br>
                    Ten years later, Snow White grows into an absolutely lovely, fair and beautiful young maiden.
                    Meanwhile,
                    the queen, who believes she had gotten rid of Snow White a decade earlier, asks her mirror once
                    again:
                    "Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?" The mirror tells her that not
                    only is
                    Snow White still the fairest in the land, but she is also currently hiding with the dwarfs.
                    The
                    queen
                    is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death by tricking the
                    huntsman,
                    and
                    decides to kill the girl herself. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old
                    peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her
                    up so
                    tightly that Snow White faints or collapses; the dwarfs return just in time, and Snow White
                    revives
                    when
                    the dwarfs loosen the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow
                    White
                    to take a beautiful comb as a present; she strokes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The
                    girl is
                    overcome by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove
                    the
                    comb
                    from her hair. Finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a
                    poisoned
                    apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the
                    white
                    (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite
                    and
                    then
                    falls into a coma or appearing to be dead, causing the Queen to think she has finally triumphed.
                    This
                    time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and, assuming that the queen has finally
                    killed
                    her,
                    they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.
                    <br><br>
                    The next day, a prince stumbles upon a seemingly-dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin
                    during a
                    hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow
                    White to
                    her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being
                    transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece
                    of
                    the
                    poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her. The Prince is overjoyed with
                    this
                    miracle, and he declares his love for the now alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet
                    him
                    face
                    to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. The prince invites everyone in the land to their
                    wedding,
                    except for Snow White's stepmother.
                    <br><br>
                    The queen, believing herself finally to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her
                    magic
                    mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there is a bride of a prince, who is
                    yet
                    fairer than she. The queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the
                    Queen
                    becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her
                    stepdaughter,
                    Snow
                    White herself. The furious Queen tries to sow chaos and attempts to kill her again, but the
                    prince
                    recognizes her as a threat to Snow White when he learns the truth from his bride. As a
                    punishment
                    for
                    the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron
                    slippers
                    and to dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow
                    White
                    has
                    taken her revenge, so her wedding to the prince peacefully continues.</span>

            <h2>The Inspiration of Snow White</h2>
            <p>Many scholars have theorized about the possible origins of the tale. In 1994, a German historian named
                Eckhard Sander published Schneewittchen: Märchen oder Wahrheit? (Snow White: Fairy Tale or Truth?),
                claiming he had uncovered an account that may have inspired the story that first appeared in Grimm’s
                Fairy Tales. According to Sander, the character of Snow White was based on the life of Margaretha von
                Waldeck, a German countess born to Philip IV in 1533. At the age of 16, Margaretha was forced by her
                stepmother, Katharina of Hatzfeld, to move away to Brussels. There, Margaretha fell in love with a
                prince who would later become Philip II of Spain. Her father and stepmother disapproved of the
                relationship, however, deeming it ‘politically inconvenient’. Margaretha mysteriously died at the age of
                21, apparently having been poisoned. Historical accounts point to the King of Spain who, in opposing the
                romance, may have dispatched Spanish agents to murder her.
