                <h2>About P!NK</h2>
                <p>
                    Alecia Beth Moore (born September 8, 1979), known professionally as Pink (stylized as P!nk), is an
                    American singer and songwriter. She was originally a member of the girl group Choice. In 1995,
                    LaFace Records saw potential in Pink and offered her a solo recording contract. Her R&B-influenced
                    debut studio album Can't Take Me Home (2000) was certified double-platinum in the United States and
                    spawned two Billboard Hot 100 top-ten songs: "There You Go" and "Most Girls". She gained further
                    recognition with the collaborative single "Lady Marmalade" from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack, which
                    topped many charts worldwide. Refocusing her sound to pop rock with her second studio album
                    Missundaztood (2001), the album sold more than 13 million copies worldwide and yielded the
                    international number-one songs "Get the Party Started", "Don't Let Me Get Me", and "Just Like a
                    Pill".
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Pink's third studio album, Try This (2003), sold significantly less than her previous work, it
                    earned her the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. She returned to the top of
                    record charts with her fourth and fifth studio albums, I'm Not Dead (2006) and Funhouse (2008),
                    which spawned the top-ten entries "Who Knew" and "U + Ur Hand", as well as the number-one single "So
                    What". Pink's sixth studio album, The Truth About Love (2012), was her first Billboard 200
                    number-one album and spawned her fourth US number-one single, "Just Give Me a Reason". In 2014, Pink
                    recorded a collaborative album, Rose Ave., with Canadian musician Dallas Green under a folk music
                    duo named You+Me. Her next studio albums, Beautiful Trauma (2017) and Hurts 2B Human (2019), both
                    debuted at atop the Billboard 200 chart, with the former becoming the world's third best-selling
                    album of the year.

                    Noted for her distinctive raspy voice and acrobatic stage presence, Pink has sold over 100
                    million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. Her career
                    accolades include three Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, a Daytime Emmy Award and seven MTV Video
                    Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. In 2009, Billboard named Pink the
                    Pop Songs Artist of the Decade. Pink was also the second most-played female solo artist in the
                    United Kingdom during the 2000s decade, behind only Madonna. VH1 ranked her at number ten on their
                    list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music, while Billboard awarded her the Woman of the Year award in
                    2013. At the 63rd annual BMI Pop Awards, she received the BMI President's Award for "her outstanding
                    achievement in songwriting and global impact on pop culture and the entertainment industry."</p>
