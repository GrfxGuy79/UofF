            <ul>
                <li>
                    #1 priority is water safety, then working on the skills to swim
                </li>
                <li>
                    I don’t follow a specific lesson program as I believe in meeting the child where they are
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The methods to teach swimming skills to your child are the same methods I used on my own boys to
                        get them swimming.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    I gain their trust before I push them out of their comfort zone
                </li>
                <li>
                    I believe in pushing them but not scaring them

                </li>
                <li> I teach each child based on their individual abilities

                </li>
                <li> I recommend 2 lessons a week and ask the parents to reinforce their skills they’ve learned in
                    either the pool or
                    some
                    cases, their bathtub.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        But the number is really dependent on the family needs/wants
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Lessons are shorter (20 – 30 minutes) because the child is moving for most of the lesson
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lessons can look like play more than instructions; some children respond better in that setting
                </li>
            </ul>

                    or is
                    already a competitor but looking to refine their strokes.
                    <br><br>At the point where the parent(s) and I believe your swimmer is strong and needs additional
                    challenge, we
                    will move this lesson to the Aberdeen lap pool to continue to work on strength, endurance and
                    continue
                    to work on stroke technique.
