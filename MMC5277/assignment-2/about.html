            <p>
                For anyone who knows me, they can tell you one of my favorite things to do, is eat! I would have to say
                that my favorite type of food has to be Mexican, I love the spice and the flavors. No Mexican meal would
                be complete without Chips &amp; Salsa, to me it sets the tone for the rest of the meal.
            </p>
