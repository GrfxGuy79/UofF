                    Today, burlesque is nothing short of an art form. Performers both male and female combine the most
                    explosive aspects of
                    costumery, dance, comedy and theater in a type of live entertainment that, of course, places nudity
                    on a pedestal. Dita
                    Von Tesse and World Famous BOB have turned the tassel-friendly genre of performance into an evolving
                    practice that
                    challenges everything conventional — from gender politics to sexuality and the public’s perception
                    of the naked body.

                    Burlesque has historic roots in America’s minstrel culture, dating as far back as the 1840s.
                    However, the version we
                    know today — a marriage of vaudevillian humor and striptease — became popular in the early 1900s,
                    when (mostly women)
                    performers took to clubs and Broadway venues with their own brand of music, dance and provocative
                    nudity. The era of
                    Prohibition took a toll on the burlesque industry, as teetotaling politicians and authority figures
                    took issue with both
                    the performers and club owners that made burlesque possible. Thankfully, the genre bit back in the
                    1950s, as women like
                    Sally Rand, Gypsy Rose Lee, Tempest Storm, Lili St. Cyr, and Blaze Starr emerged as boundary-pushing
                    icons.
